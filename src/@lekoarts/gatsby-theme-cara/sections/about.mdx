## My Story

I am a young Mechantronics engineer studying at TH-WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt. Technology has fascinated me from a very young age. As such I have been trying many different technologies. In the past, I have done explore RaspberryPi, Aeromodelling, PCB Etching, Circuit Design, Tesla Coils and a lot more. I am working on a blog to pen down the various things I have explored and found interesting.

Currently, I am playing around with Machine Learning and the Rust Programming Language.
