## My Story

From a young age, I have always been interested in technology and computers. And since I was born in Bangalore, India, which is the hub of tech sector in india. I have had ample opportunity to explore these interests. 
Staring with LEGO Mindstorms at 12 years of age, to learning C++ and Python in high school and later Rust, I have always been engaging in the field any way i could. I will be adding more and more about this in my blog.
I am a Mechatronics engineer currently studying in TH WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt.
